# Cplusplus-Program
Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
The project was made to create a banking app for a theoretical company and it was made to keep track of hours, times, dates, a menu to access the files used to tell the time and date.

What did you do particularly well?
I think that I generally coded everything very well and implemented the code with little to no errors for my fist major project.

Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I think to enhance my code the only thing that I would do is  combine the  code and make all the functions a header file and create a class to hold those functions and create an object within the code.

Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most difficult part of writing the code was displaying the menu. I used tutor.com in order to receive help figuring out the code and syntax for the functon.

What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
This project helped me to write my first functions as well as how to show displays through code.
This can help with writing functions and classes in different coding langugaes such as java and C as well especially since C++ skills are easily transferable to those langugaes.

How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
Due to it being my first project the program was not maintained very well.
However because the amount of classes and functions many of the functions can be written into and by the virtue of the functions being in seperate files it is easier to adapt 
the code to whatever may be needed without having todelve too much into the main code at all.
